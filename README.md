# About this repository

[Amlantis](http://amlantis-lang.org/) is a collection of specifications for a set of programming tools, languages and their reference implementations, all together aiming to provide programming environment friendly to the programmers, empowering them to make the world a better place.

## How to get started

Unfortunately, not so fast just yet. The intention of Amlantis is to start with a specification that is well thought-through, followed by reference implementation, verifying the specification and providing feedback loop to improve it. Current version 0.11 is a restart of the original ideas, building upon ideas from 0.10, but in a more consistent way.

## What the duck is going on now

Right now, weâ€™re trying an iterative approach to building the whole system. First, [specification](tex/0.11/AmlSpecification.pdf) gets expanded. Then, a reference implementation should follow to verify that the changes made to specification work. Ideally, this is where we would gather feedback, and based on that, make changes to the specification. And repeat.
